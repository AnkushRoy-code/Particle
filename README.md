# Particle Life Simulation

An engaging implementation of the Particle Life simulation using C++, SDL2, and Dear ImGui. Watch as particles interact and form complex patterns based on simple rules!

## Features

- Real-time particle simulation
- Customizable particle properties
- Interactive UI with Dear ImGui
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
